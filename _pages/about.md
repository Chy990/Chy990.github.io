I'm currently a **undergraduate student** in **[University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/)**. My passion lies in solving complex problems through **engineering** and **technology**. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new things, and I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting ideas.
